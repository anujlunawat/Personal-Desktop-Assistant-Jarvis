Jarvis is an AI assistant designed to perform various tasks such as web browsing, playing music, sending emails, and much more, all through voice commands. It uses Python and integrates with libraries like `selenium`, `pyttsx3`, and `speech_recognition`.

## Features

- Voice-controlled browsing: You can open websites, search for topics, navigate backward and forward, and even maximize or minimize the browser window using voice commands.
- Music Player: Play your favorite songs by simply asking Jarvis to play music.
- Email Sender: Jarvis can send emails on your behalf. Just tell it what to write and who to send it to.
- Weather Updates: Get real-time weather updates for any location just by asking Jarvis.
- News Reader: Stay updated with the latest news by having Jarvis read out news articles for you.
- Task Scheduler: Set alarms using Jarvis to remind you of important events.
